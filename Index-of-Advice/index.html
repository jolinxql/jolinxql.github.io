CS fundamentally asks what is computing, what can be computed, how can it be computed. Informatics fundamentally asks what should be computed, how should computation be used, what role does computing play in society. If you find computing intrinsically interested and wouldn’t mind talking about it endlessly, CS is a great major for you. If you just want use it as a tool to solve the world’s problems, Informatics is a great major for you. Some people are interested in both. Maybe that’s you! Both are competitive majors, both lead to wonderful jobs, and both will teach you a lot about the world, one from the perspective of computing, one from the perspective of humanity. Both perspectives are necessary and valuable.</blockquote><h3 data-reactid=".0.1.9">What makes a good research question?</h3><p data-reactid=".0.1.a"><span data-reactid=".0.1.a.0">Good questions are </span><b data-reactid=".0.1.a.1">feasible</b><span data-reactid=".0.1.a.2"> to answer (you have some method by which you can answer it), </span><b data-reactid=".0.1.a.3">novel</b><span data-reactid=".0.1.a.4"> (you’ve read enough prior work to know that the answer isn’t known), and </span><b data-reactid=".0.1.a.5">important</b><span data-reactid=".0.1.a.6"> (human beings in the world would care about the answer). It’s non-trivial to find a question that satisfies all three.</span></p><p data-reactid=".0.1.b">To assess feasibility, there are many considerations. Do you have the right skills to investigate it? Do you have access to the data you need? Does the technology support the prototype you want to make? Most importantly, do you have a special insight that gives you leverage into the program?</p><p data-reactid=".0.1.c">To assess novelty, you have to read a lot, which takes time. To accelerate this, find experts. Talk to faculty who know about every dimension of the question you’re curious about to discover the bleeding edge of knowledge on that topic. If possible, find survey articles, which synthesize large bodies of work for exactly this purpose.</p><p data-reactid=".0.1.d">To assess importance, you have to know something about what the academic world and broader society thinks is important. Developing this sense takes time, and often requires submitting research for peer review. Trust your advisors instincts, but also develop your own. Go to conferences, discuss the ideas with people in your community and see how they react to your question. Do they find it interesting or important?</p><p data-reactid=".0.1.e">If these three activities weren’t hard enough, most of them lead to failure, requiring iteration: you may find out a question isn’t feasible, that it’s already been answered, or that no one thinks the question is important. This is why Ph.D. students, who may be expected to answer multiple “good” research questions to get a Ph.D., may take 5-7 years to complete their dissertation.</p><h3 id="goodpaper" data-reactid=".0.1.f">How do I write a good research paper?</h3><p data-reactid=".0.1.g">Obviously, a few paragraphs on an advice page can’t teach you this skill. That’s what a getting a Ph.D. is for. But I’ll do my best here to give you some concepts and strategies to scaffold your practice.</p><p data-reactid=".0.1.h">First, let’s consider a typical paper outline:</p><ul data-reactid=".0.1.i"><li data-reactid=".0.1.i.0"><b data-reactid=".0.1.i.0.0">Introduction</b><span data-reactid=".0.1.i.0.1">. The beginning of a research paper is essentially an </span><i data-reactid=".0.1.i.0.2">argument</i><span data-reactid=".0.1.i.0.3"> that begins with the state of the world and makes a series of successively narrow </span><i data-reactid=".0.1.i.0.4">claims</i><span data-reactid=".0.1.i.0.5"> about the state of the world, culminating in a question, hypothesis, or hypothetical that is </span><i data-reactid=".0.1.i.0.6">not</i><span data-reactid=".0.1.i.0.7"> supported by evidence. These claims are typically the topic sentences of several paragraphs, where the content in each paragraph provides evidence for each claim. A good argument in an introduction has no logical flaws or inconsistencies and is well supported by solid evidence. If someone can find holes in your argument, the whole premise of the paper is unsound. For example, consider this completely sound argument:</span></li><ol data-reactid=".0.1.i.1"><li data-reactid=".0.1.i.1.0">Most humans find kitties cute. [Evidence…]</li><li data-reactid=".0.1.i.1.1">Cute things make people smile.  [Evidence…]</li><li data-reactid=".0.1.i.1.2">Smiling makes people happy even when they’re sad. [Evidence…]</li><li data-reactid=".0.1.i.1.3">If there were a way humans could see kitties whenever they were said, most humans could be happy [Evidence…]</li><li data-reactid=".0.1.i.1.4">How can we empower humans to see kitties whenever they want?</li><li data-reactid=".0.1.i.1.5">In this paper, we present such a way, which we call the “Internet”…</li></ol><li data-reactid=".0.1.i.2"><b data-reactid=".0.1.i.2.0">Related work</b><span data-reactid=".0.1.i.2.1">. This section (which might be interleaved in the argument in the introduction, rather than as a separate section), makes another argument: even the best, most relevant evidence we have does not answer the question we posed in the introduction. To be good, a related work section must cite “all” of the evidence available (though “all” usually isn’t feasible) and, like the introduction, be free of logical inconsistencies.</span></li><li data-reactid=".0.1.i.3"><b data-reactid=".0.1.i.3.0">Method</b><span data-reactid=".0.1.i.3.1">. Whether a paper presents empirical evidence or the design and implementation of a new system, algorithm, or technique, it must </span><i data-reactid=".0.1.i.3.2">describe</i><span data-reactid=".0.1.i.3.3"> the process by which you arrived at the answer to your research question. In an empirical paper, the method is a reproducible series of steps that were followed to arrive at the answer. In a systems contribution, it’s a technical description of the abstractions that were necessary to prototype something that answered the “how” question presented in the introduction. A good method section must be unambiguous, complete, and reproducible by someone with appropriate expertise (judging “appropriate” is hard, which makes it difficult to know how much detail to include; peer reviewers will help you with this).</span></li><li data-reactid=".0.1.i.4"><b data-reactid=".0.1.i.4.0">Results</b><span data-reactid=".0.1.i.4.1">. This section provides evidence for the answer to your research question. In an empirical study, this evidence might come in the form of qualitative or quantitative data. In a systems contribution, it might come in the form of several examples of what the system is capable of, proving that it exists and does what was claimed. A good results section is also logically sound, uses accepted techniques for producing evidence (e.g., best practices in statistics or qualitative analysis).</span></li><li data-reactid=".0.1.i.5"><b data-reactid=".0.1.i.5.0">Discussion</b><span data-reactid=".0.1.i.5.1">. The discussion returns to the claims and question in the introduction. Now that you’ve answered the question and provided evidence that the answer is sound, so what? Does the answer raise new research questions (the answer is always yes!)? What implications does the answer have for the world? The discussion is a reprisal of the related work, but reinterpreted in light of the new evidence, with a discussion of the new questions revealed by the discovery. Reveal what is most surprising about the discovery.</span></li></ul><p data-reactid=".0.1.j">Now that we’ve covered what a research paper consists of, how does one go about writing one? Part of this question is how one goes about doing research. I see research paper writing and research as interwined. Here’s the algorithm I follow for doing research and research paper writing:</p><ol data-reactid=".0.1.k"><li data-reactid=".0.1.k.0"><b data-reactid=".0.1.k.0.0">Define a research question</b><span data-reactid=".0.1.k.0.1">. Write a bulleted list of claims that lead to a research question and iterate on it until it is (roughly) logically sound. (Don’t write full prose yet, just single sentences that form an argument)</span></li><li data-reactid=".0.1.k.1"><b data-reactid=".0.1.k.1.0">Test your question against the literature</b><span data-reactid=".0.1.k.1.1">. Read all of the relevant literature to see what support there is for your claims. (How? Out of scope for this question!).</span></li><li data-reactid=".0.1.k.2"><b data-reactid=".0.1.k.2.0">Refine your research question</b><span data-reactid=".0.1.k.2.1">. When the evidence inevitably modifies, invalidates, or refines your claims and research question, return to step (1) and iterate until your argument </span><i data-reactid=".0.1.k.2.2">is</i><span data-reactid=".0.1.k.2.3"> supported by your claims (this process may take weeks or months).</span></li><li data-reactid=".0.1.k.3"><b data-reactid=".0.1.k.3.0">Derive a method that answers your question</b><span data-reactid=".0.1.k.3.1">. Now that you have a sound argument and a well-defined research question, derive a method that will answer the question. The nature of the question will determine the appropriate method (“why” and “how” questions require qualitative work, “who”/“what”/“when”/“where” questions require either quantitative or qualitative work, “how can” questions require design and invention, and “what is” questions require argumentation).</span></li><li data-reactid=".0.1.k.4"><b data-reactid=".0.1.k.4.0">Detail an analysis plan</b><span data-reactid=".0.1.k.4.1">. Based on your method, write an analysis plan that you will follow to take the results of your method and produce the answer to your research question (the statistics you will calculate, the interpretations you will make, the kinds of demos you will create, etc). This analysis plan will help you verify that your method provides the sufficient evidence for producing an answer to your research question. You’ll inevitably find that your method doesn’t support your analysis, so return to step 4 until it does.</span></li><li data-reactid=".0.1.k.5"><b data-reactid=".0.1.k.5.0">Refine your method and analysis</b><span data-reactid=".0.1.k.5.1">. Show your method and analysis plan to people with expertise with the method. Can they find any flaws in its application or its ability to answer your question? Yes they can. Iterate until they can’t. You’ll never be expert enough to see all of these flaws yourself. Note that you may find that there is no such method and analysis that feasibly answers your question; if this happens, return to step (1) and find a new research question.</span></li><li data-reactid=".0.1.k.6"><b data-reactid=".0.1.k.6.0">Execute your method</b><span data-reactid=".0.1.k.6.1">. At this point, you should have a draft of your introduction, related work, method, and analysis plan. Next, execute your method plan. This may take anywhere from a few days to years depending on your methods. And if your method is to invent or design something, you may </span><i data-reactid=".0.1.k.6.2">never</i><span data-reactid=".0.1.k.6.3"> discover an answer to your question. Therefore, you need a “timeout” that determines when you’ll stop trying and return to step (1).</span></li><li data-reactid=".0.1.k.7"><b data-reactid=".0.1.k.7.0">Execute your analysis</b><span data-reactid=".0.1.k.7.1">. Once you’re done executing your method and analysis plan, you should have the answer you were looking for: some data, a prototype, or an argument that answers your question. Execute your analysis plan. Once you’re done with this, you should have a draft of your results section, full of stats, proofs of concept, writing about your qualitative interpretations of data, or an argument.</span></li><li data-reactid=".0.1.k.8"><b data-reactid=".0.1.k.8.0">Write your discussion</b><span data-reactid=".0.1.k.8.1">.

Find the best possible form for your results: the best words, the right tables, figures, and diagrams, the most compelling screenshots, the clearest, most concise sentences.

Some people do the above in an entirely different order, and sometimes that works out. This is particularly true of invention, where you might just start with an interesting “what if”, spend months or years inventing, and then return to the rest of the steps above to figure out what the problem was, what the related work is, etc. All of these alternatives are a perfectly reasonable alternative to the process I sketch out above, but I find that any deviation from the process above tends to be less reliable at producing good research. I use the approach above, and out of the ~90 papers I’ve submitted in my career so far, only 10 were never published.

Do the authors cite means of distributions that may not be normally distributed? Skew, floor effects, ceiling affects, and multi-modal distributions can make some aggregate statistics meaningless.

Do the authors use causality language like “influence”, “causes”, or “leads to” for an experiment in which they can make no causal claims?

Do the authors make statements about non-obvious phenomena without sufficient evidence (either data or some citation)? Scour the paper for these statements and point them all out.

Do the authors violate any assumptions of the statistical tests that they use?

I’m definitely not the expert on this, but I have a few pointers. First, publishing this work is all about setting up your claims and supporting them. Which subtle design decisions were important and what evidence do you have of this? One class of work that comes to mind is Luis von Ahn’s human computation work. None of the games he’s written about have intrinsically interesting technical properties, but most are subtle design choices (see </span><a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1124782" data-reactid=".0.1.w.1" target="_blank" rel="external">Peekaboom</a><span data-reactid=".0.1.w.2">). I also think of Julie Kientz work, since most of her papers are about applications with fairly simple features, but composed in domain-significant ways (see </span><a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1180909" data-reactid=".0.1.w.3" target="_blank" rel="external">Abaris</a><span data-reactid=".0.1.w.4">). Caitlin Kelleher’s dissertation work also had several nice measurements. She was interested in motivating middle school girls to program and made several subtle design choices to do this. The key to her work was finding ways to measure motivation; she decided to inject breaks into her sessions and see if the kids would sneak in extra time, sacrificing their breaks (see </span><a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1240844" data-reactid=".0.1.w.5" target="_blank" rel="external">Storytelling Alice</a><span data-reactid=".0.1.w.6">).</span></p><h3 data-reactid=".0.1.x">Should I review this paper?</h3><p data-reactid=".0.1.y">My Ph.D. students often ask me whether they should accept a paper review request.
